Major discoveries:

-) Coder must usually declare and initialize strings at the same time.
   Eg:
	char thisIsAString[50] = “I am a string literal because of the double quotes.”;

-) String literals cannot be changed later on, which is an obvious one due to the stated variable type.
   Eg:
	char thisIsAString[50] = “I am a string literal.”;
	… other code …
	thisIsAString = ‘I have been changed?’;

-) Can’t declare a string of a certain size and then later assign chars in the array using the “= [‘’,’’,…];” syntax or the ‘= “ “;’.
   Eg:
	char willThisBeAString[50];
	… other code …
	willThisBeAString = {‘A’,’m’,’ ‘,’I’,’ ‘,’a’,’ ‘,’s’,’t’,’r’,’i’,’n’,’g’,’?’};
	The compiler says it was not the “expected expression.”
   Eg:
	char willThisBeAString[50];
	… other code …
	willThisBeAString = “Am I a string”;
	The compiler says the “array type ‘char [50]’ is not assignable.”
   Eg:
	char willThisBeAString[50];
	… other code …
	willThisBeAString = ‘This is a bigger string.’;
	Compiles just fine

-) The type of ‘string variables’ cannot be changed.
   Eg:
	char willThisBeAString[50]
	… other code …
	willThisBeAString = malloc(sizeof(*willThisBeAString) * 256);
	The compiler says the “array type ‘char[50]’ is not assignable.”
